# Fitfixer

## 

## Introduction

Currently, FIT files recorded by the Tymewear experience two little issues:

1. Power is recorded in a custom field "tymewear power" wheres the standard field "power" remains unset.
2. Cadence is recorded as half the value.

The Fitfixer tool fixes these issues.

## How to use

```bash
python fitfixer.py <input file> <output file>
```
